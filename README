This is the repository for the 42sh project. This file shall contain anything related to our implementation of 42sh.

USAGE:

In order to be able to use 42sh, do as follows :
	- mkdir build
	- cd into build directory
	- call cmake .. to start building. (../ being the path to the CMakeLists.txt file)
	- call make 42sh to build the 42sh binary.

Then, once the binary is created, the 42sh can be used with :

	./42sh [options] [arguments]


LAUNCHING TESTS

In order to launch the test suite, go into the build directory created during the USAGE part and call :

	make check_unit

As up to now, the test suite launches tests that are : lexer/parser testing, grammar testing, ast build testing.

Individual tests can also be done by calling :

        make check_[TEST]

Where [TEST] is either lexer,grammar,ast or 42sh. The results of testing 42sh will be printed in a file named "results.txt".

FEATURES:

To this point, our 42sh should be compliant with the 0.3 version asked.
Thus, it can handle :

	- execution of simple commands
	- "if" statements
	- "while" and "until" statements
	- "for" statements

Moreover, even if it is not fully usable yet, its parser is able to check for the grammar-compliance of any sequence of token given as an input.
