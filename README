This is the repository for the 42sh project. This file shall contain anything related to our implementation of 42sh.

USAGE:

In order to be able to use 42sh, do as follows :
	- mkdir build
	- cd into build directory
	- call cmake .. to start building. (../ being the path to the CMakeLists.txt file)
	- call make 42sh to build the 42sh binary.

Then, once the binary is created, the 42sh can be used with :

	./42sh [options] [arguments]

The tty mode can be launched with:

        ./42sh [options]

The 42sh can be launched with a file by doing:

        ./42sh < file


LAUNCHING TESTS

In order to launch the test suite, go into the build directory created during the USAGE part and call :

	make check

Options can also be given to the test suite when calling it manually. The script
to start the test suite is located in tests/test_scripts/test_options.sh
The available options are :

        -l or --list to list all the available test categories.

        -t <time> or --timeout <time> to set a timeout of <time> seconds for all
        tests.

        -c <categories> or --category <categories> to call the tests in <categories>

FEATURES:

To this point, our 42sh should be compliant with the 0.5 version asked.
Thus, it can handle :

	- execution of simple commands
	- "if" statements
	- "while" and "until" statements
	- "for" statements
        - "case" statements
        - function declarations and use
        - tty with PS1 and PS2 variables.
        - pipe commands, operator handling (&& and ||)
        - take a file as input with redirection
        - creates a ~/.42sh_history file and reads from it
	- loads /etc/.42shrc and ~/.42shrc
        - assignment of variables and expansion with '$'
	- exit builtin
	- echo builtin (without quoting) with all its options.
	- cd builtin
	- export builtin
	- alias and unalias builtins
	- shopt implemented with its -s -u and -q options

Moreover, even if it is not fully usable yet, its parser is able to check for the grammar-compliance of any sequence of token given as an input.

CREATING DOC  IN HTML

In order to create the documentation here is what to do:

	doxygen configure

After doing that the directory "html/" will be created. You can access the doc with command:

	firefox html/index.html
